HOW TO READ THE Z TABLE

2) Z tables are (unlike most other statistical tables) 1 dimensional (as opposed to for example chi sq tables, where you have the degrees of freedom on the rows and the value of the statistcs on the columns). My confusion and my bad. 

When you read a z-statistics table the rows indicate the z value to some precision, the different columns indicate further precision. So the way to get your value is: look for the row wich has the largest number smaller than the one you got

e.g. your z statistics is 1.373, choose row 1.3,

then look for the column with the closest decimal digi (but smaller than the one in your result for a conservative result) for more refined precision (that's  0.07 in this example) which gives you 0.9147.

the p-value is the number at the interception of rows and columns is 1- the number you read off the table:

 1-0.9147 = 0.0853

 

HOW TO READ THE CHI SQ TABLE

chi sq tables are 2 dimensional, because the chi-square distribution is different for different degrees of freedom.

The degrees of freedom (generally) equal the number of observations minus the number of dependent variables. For a test of proportions between 2 samples that is 2 observations (the percentage in each sample) and 1 independent variable (e.g. participating in a program or not)

ROW: look for the row with the right number of degrees of freedom (sometimes the column, depending on who wrote the table, but generally row).

COLUMN: look for the column that stated the statistical significance you require (e.g. 0.05 for alpha=0.05!)

the number at the interception of the row and column is the MINIMUM CHI SQ significant value. Meaning if you got a value larger than that you have rejection of null at the p value corresponding to the alpha you have set.
