# UInotebooks


this is a repo contains ALL code generated for [Principles of Urban Informatics Class at NYU CUSP Fall 2016](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/~fb55/PUI2016/) for all the lectures taught by [(http://cosmo.nyu.edu/~fb55/](FBB). 

(previous years: [2015 is here ](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/~fb55/UI_CUSP_2015))

for the current homework sets and labs go to [this](http://github.com/fedhere/PUI2016) Github repo.



this includes notebooks that will be explored in class, notebooks to be used as templates for lab sessions, and notebooks that generate plots used in the class.

to run the notebooks, make sure that you have a directory for the plots, and outputs to be stored in, identified by environmental variables PUI2015, PUI15PLOTS, PUI2016 etc, as needed.

numerous python packages are needed: numpy, scipy, sklearn, statsmodules, pandas. 

mostly I try to be PEP8 compliant, but I am sloppy sometimes.
